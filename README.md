# VBA_challenge

In this challenge, I created VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data that loops through all the stocks for one year.

#Summary

* Set Variables
* Created scripts to get output of "The ticker symbol, Yearly change, The percentage change, The total stock volume".
* Created summary table for the dataset.
* Formatted positive value in green and negative value in red with ColorIndex.
* Created scripts for "Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease, and Greatest total volume".

# Lastly, I made sure to run my scripts on every worksheet.
